## Chapter 4

### Links

Links are features embeded in a website that allow you to move from one page to another, aka "Surfing" or "Browsing".
Common examples of links are:
- Links from one page to another on the same website
- Links that open in a new browser window, and
- Links from one website to another

You can creat links using the <a> tag. Users can click on anything set with in the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You can
be specific on what pages you want to link using the "href" attribute.
  
for example: <a href="http://imdb.com">IMDB</a>
