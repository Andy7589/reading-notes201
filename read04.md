## Chapter 4

### Links

Links are features embeded in a website that allow you to move from one page to another, aka "Surfing" or "Browsing".
Common examples of links are:
- Links from one page to another on the same website
- Links that open in a new browser window, and
- Links from one website to another

You can creat links using the <a> tag. Users can click on anything set with in the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You can
be specific on what pages you want to link using the "href" attribute.
  
for example:  <a href = "http://imdb.com">IMDB</a>

**Directiry structre**

The root folder contains all of the other files and folder for a website. The relationship between files and folders in a website can be discribed as a "family tree". The homepage of a site is writen with HTML and is called index.html. Web servers are set up to return the index.html file is it doesnt specify a name.

**Relative URLS**

When you link a page to your own site, you dont have to specity the domain name, just you relative URLs which is a short way to telling the browser where a page is.
