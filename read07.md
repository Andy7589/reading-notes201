### Tables

A table represents information in a grid foramt.

**Basic Table Structure**

 A table element(s) structre would look like this: 
 - ```<table>```
(*The table is used to create a table. This will be writen one by one*)
 - ```<tr>```
(*You can indicate the start of each row using this opening tag*)
 - ```<td>```
 (*Each cell of a table can be represented with this tag*)
 - ```<th>```
(*This is used just like the <td> tag, but its purpose is to represent the heading*)
 
 **Long Table**
 
 There are three elements that help distinguish the main content of the table and the first 
 and last row. These tags help those who use screen readers and also allows you to style 
 these sections.
 Examples of these tags are:
 - ```<thead>```
 (*The heading of the table should sit inside the <thead> tag*)
 - ```<tbody>```
 (*The body should sit inside the <tbody> tag*)
 - ```<tfoot>```
 (*The footer belongs inside the <tfoot> tag*)
