### Controlling The Position of Elements

CSS had the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow,
relative positioining, and absolute positioning.
Examples of these positioins are:

- Normal Flow
(*Every block-level element appears on  a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than
 the previous one.*)
- Relative Positioning
(*This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom,
 or left of where it would have been placed*)
- Absolute Postioning
