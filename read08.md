### Controlling The Position of Elements

CSS had the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow,
relative positioining, and absolute positioning.
Examples of these positioins are:

- **Normal Flow ```postion:static```**
(*Every block-level element appears on  a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than
 the previous one.*)
 
 
 
- **Relative Positioning**
(*This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom,
 or left of where it would have been placed*)
- **Absolute Postioning**
(*This postions the element in relation to its containing element*)
- **Fixed Positioning**
(*This is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window, as
 opposed to the containing element*)
- **Floating Elements**
(*Floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right
 of a containing box*)

By using the ```z-index``` property, you'll be able to control which box appears on top.
