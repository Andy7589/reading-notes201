## Chapter 16: "Images"

### Controlling Sizes of Images in CSS

Specifing image sizes helps pages to load smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download. You can control the size of an image using the width and the height properties in CSS.

### Background Images

The ```background-image``` property allows you to place an image behind any HTML elemnt. The path to the imagefollows the letters **url**, and it is put inside parentheses and quotes. An example code of this is: ```body {background-image: url("images/patterns.gif");}```.

### Background Positioning

You can use the ```background-position``` property to speficy where in the browser window the background image should be placed. Examples of background positioning code could look like this:

```body {background-position: insert here ;}```

- ```left top```
- ```left center```
- ```left bottom```
- ```center top```
- ```center center```
- ```center bottom```
- ```right top```
- ```right center```
- ```right bottom```
